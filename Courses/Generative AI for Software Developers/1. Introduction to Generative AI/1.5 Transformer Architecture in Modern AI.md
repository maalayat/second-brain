## Introduction
The transformer architecture has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and is foundational for advanced large language models like GPT and Gemini. This summary explores the basics of transformers, their significance, and key concepts.

## Background
- **Introduction of Transformers**: The transformer model was introduced in the 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al.
- **Advancements in Machine Learning**: Prior to transformers, supervised learning and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were used to handle sequences of information, but they had limitations in understanding deep meanings in text.

## Key Features of Transformers
- **Parallel Processing**: Transformers process all parts of the data simultaneously, which enhances training speed and improves the handling of long-range dependencies in text.
- **Example of Contextual Understanding**: The example sentence illustrates how context influences predictions. The phrase "In Ireland, I went to secondary school" leads to the prediction of "Irish" or "Gaelic" as the next token, showcasing the importance of context in understanding language.

## Conclusion
While the technical details of transformers are complex, two key concepts are essential for understanding their impact on NLP.
