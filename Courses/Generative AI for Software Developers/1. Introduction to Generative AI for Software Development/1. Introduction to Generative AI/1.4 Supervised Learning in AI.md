## What is Supervised Learning?
- **Definition**: Supervised learning involves training a model on a dataset that pairs inputs with correct outputs, similar to teaching with flashcards.
- **Applications**: Common applications include spam detection in email systems and diagnostic imaging in healthcare.

## Real-World Example: Diabetic Retinopathy
- **Problem**: Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of preventable blindness, exacerbated by a shortage of eye specialists, particularly in countries like India.
- **Solution**: Researchers created a dataset of retinal scans graded by doctors to train a machine learning algorithm. This model can diagnose conditions as accurately, or even better than, human specialists.
- **Additional Findings**: The model also discovered correlations between retinal images and other patient data, such as age and gender, achieving a 97% accuracy in predicting a person's birth-assigned gender from the images.

## Applications of Supervised Learning
- **Versatility**: Supervised learning can be applied to various types of labeled data, including images, sounds, and text.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Techniques from supervised learning have led to the development of LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini, which are trained on extensive text data to understand and generate coherent text.
