## Definition
AI systems that generate new content.

## Applications
- Code generation
- Content creation (images, videos, music)
- Enhancing software development
### Software Development
#### Role of AI
- Assists in coding (e.g., GitHub Copilot)
	- Enhances efficiency in development tools (search engines, recommendation systems, IDEs) 
- Skills Development:
	- Integrating generative AI
	- Enhancing coding skills with LLMs (Large Language Models)
#### Examples of Generative AI Tools
- GitHub Copilot: Suggests code as you type.
- DALL-E: Generates images from text descriptions.
#### Implications for Developers
- Paradigm shift in problem-solving
- Automation of creativity
- Reduced time from concept to product
- Competitive edge in various projects (enterprise applications, indie games)
