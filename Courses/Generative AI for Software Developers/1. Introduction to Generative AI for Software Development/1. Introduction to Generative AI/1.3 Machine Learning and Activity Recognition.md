## Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning represents a significant shift in how computers can autonomously determine rules for completing tasks based on provided data and answers.

## Activity Recognition Problem
The goal is to develop an application that utilizes sensors from devices (like phones or watches) to identify a person's activity (e.g., walking, running, biking).

### Initial Rule-Based Approach
- **Speed-Based Rules**: 
  - A basic rule could be established: if speed is below 4 mph, the user is walking; if above, they are running. 
  - This can be extended to include biking by adding another speed threshold (below 12 mph).
### Limitations of Rule-Based Approach
- **Naivety of Rules**: 
  - The initial rules are simplistic and do not account for variations in speed due to terrain (e.g., running downhill vs. biking uphill).
- **Challenge of Other Activities**: 
  - Differentiating between activities like golfing and walking poses additional challenges.

## Machine Learning as a Solution
Instead of manually writing rules, machine learning can be employed to identify patterns in the data.

### Data Collection and Labeling
- **Activity Data**: 
  - Users wear the device while performing various activities, and data is collected and labeled (e.g., walking, running, biking, golfing).
### Pattern Recognition
- **Matching Data to Labels**: 
  - The machine learns to identify patterns in the data that correspond to specific activities, improving reliability over manual rules.

## Implementing Machine Learning
### Process Overview
1. **Initial Guess**: 
   - Start with a hypothesis about the relationship between data and labels.
2. **Comparison**: 
   - Compare guesses against labeled data to assess accuracy.
3. **Optimization**: 
   - Use the results to refine guesses, repeating the process to enhance accuracy.

### Tools and Frameworks
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 
  - Tools like TensorFlow provide APIs to facilitate this process.

## Conclusion: Supervised Learning
The ultimate goal is to create a model that can predict activities based on learned patterns from the data. This approach is known as supervised learning, which will be explored further in subsequent discussions.
