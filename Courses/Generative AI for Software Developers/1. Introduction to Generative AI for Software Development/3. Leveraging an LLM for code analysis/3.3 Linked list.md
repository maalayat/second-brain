## Introduction
The text discusses the common computer science assignment of implementing a linked list and the implications of using Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for coding tasks. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the code generated by LLMs to avoid accumulating technical debt.

## Understanding Linked Lists
- **Purpose**: Linked lists are designed to address the limitations of arrays, particularly in terms of inserting and removing elements efficiently.
- **Structure**: Unlike arrays, linked lists store elements in non-contiguous memory locations, using pointers to link each element to the next.
- **Advantages**: They allow for flexible insertion and deletion without the need for shifting elements, making them a useful data structure.

## Limitations of Linked Lists
- While linked lists solve some problems associated with arrays, they come with their own overheads and potential issues.
- The text encourages readers to think critically about these downsides and to engage with LLMs to explore them further.

## Engaging with LLMs
- **Pair Programming**: The author suggests using LLMs as coding partners to gain insights into potential issues with linked lists.
- **Feedback Loop**: Users are encouraged to ask LLMs follow-up questions to deepen their understanding of the code and its implications.
- **Learning Opportunity**: Engaging in a dialogue with LLMs can provide multiple perspectives, similar to collaborating with different colleagues.

## Security and Performance Considerations
- The text highlights the importance of considering security risks when implementing linked lists in production environments, such as resource exhaustion and memory leaks.
- Users can prompt LLMs to suggest improvements for security and performance, including input validation and concurrency control.

## Practical Exercise
```
Write some code to implement a linked list in python

```
```
What are the downsides and overheads associated with linked lists compared to other python data structures?
```
```
Can you give me an example of where (3) could be a problem?
```
```
How would you modify the code to mitigate against these? 
```
```
Take on the role of an expert software developer at a company that suffers from denial of service attacks. If I implement some routines with code like this, what risks am I facing?
```
1. Add code to remove a node
2. Have LLM profile new code
## Conclusion
- The text concludes by stressing the growing expectations on developers as LLMs become more capable.
- It encourages familiarity with LLMs to enhance coding practices and prepare for more complex data structures in future implementations.

## Final Thoughts
- The author emphasizes that while simple structures like linked lists may not be used in production, they serve as a foundation for understanding more complex data structures and the role of LLMs in coding.
