## Introduction to Graphs
- **Linear vs. Non-linear Structures**: Previously discussed linear data structures (arrays, linked lists) and non-linear structures (trees).
- **Definition of Graphs**: A graph models relationships between objects, consisting of nodes (entities) and edges (connections).

## Applications of Graphs
- **Navigation**: Online maps use graphs where locations are nodes and roads are edges.
- **Social Networks**: Users are nodes connected by edges representing friendships.
- **Shopping Recommendations**: Items are nodes, with edges representing relationships like co-purchases.

## Types of Graphs
- **Directed vs. Undirected**: 
  - Directed graphs have one-way connections (e.g., flights).
  - Undirected graphs have two-way connections (e.g., roads).

## Practical exercise

```
I have this Python Graph implementation code:

<code>

As my Python mentor, please add detailed comments that explain this code. Highlight any complex parts that might require deeper explanation
```

```
What are the downsides and overheads associated with this code?
And how to would you modify the code to mitigate against these?
```

```
In my new ImprovedGraph

As a software tester, analyze this code for potential edge cases and suggest robust handling strategies and add to 'Example usage', for example:

# Example usage
graph.remove_vertex(3234) # Should raise an exception
```

```
This code doesn't appear to do a directed graph -- A is connected to B, but B is not connected to A -- please fix it
```

```
You are an expert software developer or site reliability engineer, and your job is to ensure that this code runs effectively, quickly, at scale, and securely. Please profile it, and find any issues that need to be fixed or updated.
```

```
Please go through and edit the code to (implement the recommendations)*, add input validation, add make it as memory efficient as possible
```

## Conclusion
- Graphs are versatile data structures with numerous applications, and understanding their implementation and potential issues is crucial for effective use in software development.
