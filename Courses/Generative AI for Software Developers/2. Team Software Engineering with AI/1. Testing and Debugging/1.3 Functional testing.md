## Overview

Functional testing is a crucial step in verifying that an application performs correctly and according to specifications. It involves writing test cases to ensure each function of the code works as expected.

## Key Points

* Functional testing takes the parts of exploratory testing that check the code worked as expected and gives them a structure that will be useful later when testing is automated.
* The goal of functional testing is to check the application's functionality against predefined requirements.
* Large Language Models (LLMs) are useful for writing good manual tests, but these alone will never be enough for large code bases.

## Example Usage

```
I'm working on a «todo list» app. Here is the code:

«code»

In exploratory testing, the tester came with these lines of code:
# Example usage
# Add a task
add_task("Buy")
# other explaratory testing

As an expert software tester, write code that converts the output of the exploratory testing into functional tests using «the unittest module in pyton»
```
## Next Steps

* Automated testing is critical for large code bases, and LLMs can make automated testing easier for you and your entire team.
