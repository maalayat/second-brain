## Introduction
The video discusses the importance of testing in software development, particularly focusing on manual testing and exploratory testing. It emphasizes the role of software testers in creating effective testing processes and how leveraging a Language Model (LLM) can enhance testing activities.

### Manuel testing
Manual testing is when a person tests a software application by using it and checking if it works correctly. **Exploratory testing** is a more informal type of testing where the tester explores the application without predefined test cases. The goal is to discover bugs or issues by using the application in the same way a user would.

The idea behind exploratory testing is to put yourself in the user's shoes and think about how they might use the application. By doing this, you can identify any issues or unexpected behavior early in the development process. This type of testing is especially important when there are no predefined test cases or when the application is still being developed.
## Prompt Example
```
You are a software engineer and tester who is curious and who likes to go through code looking for edge cases. There's some Python code here -- please explore it and find any issues that might cause bugs or poor functionality:

«my code»
```
## Conclusion
By incorporating exploratory testing into your development process and thinking about testing from the beginning, you can make it easier for your colleagues and ensure that your code works as expected.
