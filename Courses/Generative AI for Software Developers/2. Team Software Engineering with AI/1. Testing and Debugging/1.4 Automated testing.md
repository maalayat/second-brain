## Introduction

Automated testing is an extension of functional testing that uses software tools to carry out repetitive tasks automatically, saving time and ensuring consistency. In this section, we will explore how to use pytest, a powerful and flexible testing framework for Python, to write simple and scalable test cases.
## Why Automated Testing?
* Manual functional testing can be time-consuming and prone to human error.
* Automated testing provides quick feedback and the ability to catch issues early.
* It helps maintain the quality and reliability of software over time.
## Pytest Basics
* Pytest is a powerful and flexible testing framework for Python.
* It makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases.
* It comes with useful features like fixtures and parameterized testing.
* To use pytest, you need to install it by running `pip install pytest` in your terminal.
## Writing Tests with Pytest
* Pytest can automatically discover and run tests, providing a clean and readable output.
* Tests can be included directly in Python code scripts or in separate files in a subdirectory, prefixed with the name `tests`.
* Pytest looks for functions within code that are prefixed with the word `test`.
* Here's an example of how to write a test case for a to-do list using pytest.
## Using an LLM to Help with Testing
* With a prompt that assigns a role, you can get an LLM to help you build your test suite.
* The LLM can write test code for you, including test cases for different scenarios.
* The LLM can also help you write tests in a consistent style, which can be helpful for you and your teammates.

## Example Test Cases
```
You are an expert in PyTst for automated testing of python code. Please amend this code with a comprehensive set of tests in PyTest to find bugs or other issues in the code.
```
## Running Tests with Pytest
* To run tests with pytest, you can use the `pytest` command followed by the name of the file containing the tests.
* Pytest will automatically discover and run the tests, providing a clean and readable output.

## Conclusion
* Automated testing is an important part of software development, and pytest is a powerful tool for writing simple and scalable test cases.
* With the help of an LLM, you can generate test cases and write tests in a consistent style.
* In the next video, we will explore performance testing, which involves testing how well your code functions under different conditions.
