## Utilizing LLMs for Testing
- **Prompting Best Practices**: The text emphasizes the importance of specific prompts when interacting with LLMs. Key strategies include:
	- **Be specific:**  Providing detailed context about the problem
	- **Assign a role:** Assigning roles to tailor the output you receive.
	- **Request an expert opinion:** Assign an expert role and ask the LLM to evaluate the work you've already done to further refine it.
	- **Give feedback:** Iteratively prompt the LLM and provide feedback on the output you receive to get closer to your expected results 

- **Example Prompt**: An example prompt is provided to guide the LLM in generating test cases:
```
As an expert software tester who is teaching a new person how to write test cases, can you please analyze this code, and provide a set of test cases, explaining each one:
```
## LLM Output and Test Cases
- **Output Analysis**: The LLM analyzes the provided code and suggests several test cases, including:
  - Basic greeting functionality.
  - URL encoding handling (e.g., handling spaces in names).
  - Additional cases for special characters, empty names, and numeric inputs.

- **Implementation**: The model also provides implementations for each suggested test case, focusing on functionality and representing manual exploratory testing typically conducted during early development.
