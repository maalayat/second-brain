## Introduction
Performance testing is crucial for ensuring applications operate efficiently under expected user loads. This guide focuses on measuring execution time and identifying performance bottlenecks using Python libraries.

## Key Concepts
### Measuring Execution Time
- The video demonstrates a computationally intensive task: finding prime numbers within a specified range and calculating their sum.

How would I measure how long it takes to cal the «» function in Python

«code»
```
- Example: Summing primes between 1 and 100,000 yields approximately 454 million.
- Python's `timeit` function is recommended for measuring execution time.

### Identifying Performance Bottlenecks
- The `cProfile` library is introduced as a tool to pinpoint where time is spent in the code.
- Initial execution time for the prime-finding function is over 40 seconds, with the `is_prime` function identified as a significant bottleneck.

## Using LLM for Code Improvement
```
Rewrite my is_prime function in the code below to be more optimized. Below the code is the output from a CProfile analysis of the function
```
- An LLM (Language Model) can assist in optimizing code by providing insights and suggestions based on performance profiling.
- By including profiling results in prompts, users can receive targeted advice for optimizing specific functions.

### Optimization Example
- After optimization, the execution time for the prime-finding function is significantly reduced to a fraction of a second.
- The optimized function still shows some bottleneck but performs much better than the original.

## Practical Application
- Users are encouraged to experiment with the provided code and test larger values to observe performance improvements.
- The importance of detailed context in prompts to the LLM is emphasized for obtaining useful responses.
