## Introduction
In this lesson, we will explore how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to test for security vulnerabilities in code. We will use the principles learned throughout the course, particularly giving the LLM a role as a security expert.

### Step 1: Identify Potential Vulnerabilities
* Use the LLM to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code
```
You are an expert in web security and in creating API endpoints. With the following code, there are likely many vulnerabilities, Can you create some test cases that test against these vulnerabilities?
```
* Provide the code to the LLM and ask it to generate test cases for the vulnerabilities it might see
* The LLM can identify vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting attacks, and insecure password storage
### Step 2: Generate Test Cases
* Use the LLM to generate test cases for the identified vulnerabilities
* The LLM can provide a list of potential vulnerabilities and test cases to help identify issues
### Step 3: Run Test Cases and Identify Issues
* Run the test cases to identify issues in the code
* The LLM can help identify issues such as direct access to user records, exposed data, and insecure password storage

## Best Practices for Using LLMs in Security Testing
* Use the LLM to generate test cases and identify potential vulnerabilities
* Work with the LLM to come up with improvements to the code that mitigate identified issues
* Avoid having the LLM rewrite the code wholesale, instead follow a procedural approach:
	+ Profile the code
	+ Generate test cases
	+ Test against those cases
	+ Find issues
	+ Drill down into specific issues
	+ Have the LLM work with you to fix those
	+ Repeat this process until satisfied that the code is secure

## Conclusion
Using LLMs in security testing can help reduce the effort required to identify and fix vulnerabilities. By building testing considerations into coding practice from the beginning, developers can set themselves up for more productive and communicative relationships with colleagues in testing and security roles.
