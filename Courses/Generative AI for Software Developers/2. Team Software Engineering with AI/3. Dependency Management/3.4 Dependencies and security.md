## Introduction
Dependencies are essential for software development, allowing developers to leverage existing work. However, they can also introduce security vulnerabilities. Understanding and mitigating these risks is vital for maintaining secure projects.

## Sources of Security Issues
1. **Outdated Packages**: 
   - Packages are frequently updated to address vulnerabilities. Missing notifications about updates, especially for deep dependencies, can lead to security risks.
   
2. **Transitive Packages**: 
   - Keeping track of updates and flaws in transitive dependencies (those not directly used) is challenging, increasing the risk of using outdated or vulnerable versions.

3. **Unmaintained Packages**: 
   - Relying on packages that are no longer maintained poses significant risks, as known vulnerabilities may not be addressed.

## Example of Introducing Vulnerabilities
```
How can I check that the packages in my current Python environment are secure?
```

```
When I run pip-audit, I get a warning PYSEC-2023-62 in flask 1.0. Can you explain this?
```

## LLMs and dependency security
- LLMs are limited by the data they have access to
	- Know the cutoff date of your model's training data
	- Know whether your model can search the web
- Use LLMs in pasrallel with other tools
	- Don't rely exclusively on LLMs to **identify** vulnerabilities
	- LLMs can be very useful in resolving vulnerabilities

## Conclusion
- LLMs can be valuable tools for resolving vulnerabilities once identified, but they should be used in conjunction with dedicated security tools. This approach ensures a more reliable and comprehensive strategy for maintaining the security of software dependencies.
