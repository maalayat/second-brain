## Introduction
Virtual environments are essential for effective dependency management in software development. They provide isolated workspaces for projects, preventing conflicts between different libraries and frameworks.

## What is a Virtual Environment?
- **Definition**: An isolated workspace for managing project-specific dependencies.
- **Purpose**: To avoid conflicts between projects that may require different versions of the same library or framework.

## Benefits of Using Virtual Environments
1. **Isolation**: Each project has its own dependencies, unaffected by updates from other projects.
2. **Reproducibility**: Projects can be shared with teammates, ensuring consistent environments.
3. **Manageability**: Easier to maintain and update dependencies when setups are isolated.

## Prompt example
```
You are an expert in Python virtual environment setup. What steps can I follow to set up a virtual environment on my Mac using venv?
```

## Conclusion
Virtual environments are a powerful tool for managing dependencies in software development. By following the outlined steps, developers can create isolated environments that enhance project organization and collaboration. In the next module, the focus will shift to using LLMs to make informed decisions about library selection.
