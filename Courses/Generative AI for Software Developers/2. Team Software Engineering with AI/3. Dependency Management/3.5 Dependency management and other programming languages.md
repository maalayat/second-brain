## Introduction
This module discusses the role of dependencies in software development and how Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist in managing the complexities associated with them. While examples are primarily in Python, the concepts are applicable across various programming languages.

## Strengths
- Brainstorm libraries and packages to use for your for projects
- Learn more about a dependency
- Identify dependency conflicts and vulnerabilities
- Suggest solutions to issues with dependencies

## Weaknesses
- LLMs may not know about dependency changes past their training date (some models do search the web)
- May be less helpful or accurate with obscure libraries that are rarely in their training data
## Application in Other Languages
- **Example with JavaScript**: The module highlights the use of NPM (Node Package Manager) for managing dependencies in JavaScript projects.
  - **Package Management**: NPM not only installs packages but also ensures correct dependency versions.
  - **LLM Assistance**: Developers can use LLMs to analyze code and audit dependencies using commands like `npm audit` and `npm outdated`.

How can I check the following package.json for known dependency issues?

«package.json»
```
## Best Practices
- Use LLMs to summarize libraries available
- Debug dependency conflicts
- Help sort through potential vulnerabilities
- Get oriented with new environments and make wise choices with teams

## Conclusion

LLMs can be a valuable tool for managing dependencies and tackling problems in software development, regardless of the language or framework used. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs, developers can use them to build more exciting projects.
