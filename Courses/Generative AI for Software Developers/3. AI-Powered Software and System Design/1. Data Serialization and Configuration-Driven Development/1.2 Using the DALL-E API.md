## Introduction
This text discusses the process of building an application that utilizes the DALL-E model from OpenAI, highlighting the transition from using a large language model (LLM) for code generation to employing generative AI for image creation.

## Development Experience and Challenges
- **Caution with LLM Outputs**: The author emphasizes the importance of not blindly trusting LLM-generated code, as the API was subject to changes, leading to deprecated libraries.
```
You are a deep expert on the OpenAI ecosystem, including the client libraries, REST endpoints, and any other way of accessing functionality of GPT, DALL-E, and other models.

Please create easy to read, easy to follow code that will call DALL-E to generate an image. The code should be in Python, and all parameters should be in an external file that the Python code reads.

Please use the most up-to-date design pattern.
```
- **Explicit Prompting**: When seeking code from an LLM, clear and detailed prompts are essential to guide the model effectively.
- **Refactoring Code**: The author faced challenges with deprecated libraries and had to refactor the code to use the correct API endpoint, demonstrating the need for continuous testing and adaptation.
```
Can you create code that accesses the OpenAI endpoint at: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create directly to create an image?
```

## Best Practices for Using LLMs
- Treat the LLM as a collaborative tool rather than a sole code generator.
- Provide specific information, such as the desired API endpoint, to receive accurate and functional code.
- Identify and externalize configurable parameters to improve code design and maintainability.

## Conclusion
The text concludes by encouraging readers to continue refining their application by externalizing parameters and utilizing LLMs effectively, setting the stage for further development in the next video.
