## Benefits of the Template Method Pattern
The template method pattern is useful when you want to define a skeleton of an algorithm while allowing subclasses to modify parts of that algorithm without changing the structure. This pattern is particularly useful when there are general steps that need to be followed, but the specifics of those steps can vary depending on the subclass.

## Prompt

```
Great - the third pattern you mentioned was the Template Method Pattern. Can you demonstrate where, how, and why you would use it in this code? What advantages would it bring?
```

## Advantages and Examples

While the example implementation may seem simple, the template method pattern can be useful in more complex scenarios. For example, when working with foreign companies, we may need to postprocess the data to convert currencies or adjust time zones. The LLM suggests several examples of data postprocessing that are specific to foreign companies, including:
* Converting currencies for comparison with American companies
* Adjusting time zones for lining up data from different countries
* Implementing sample code for these adjustments
