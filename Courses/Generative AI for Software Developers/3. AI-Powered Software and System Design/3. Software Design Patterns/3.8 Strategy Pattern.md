## What is the Strategy Pattern?
The strategy pattern is a pattern that enables you to define a strategy interface and implement concrete strategies that can be easily interchangeable. This pattern is useful when you need to have different ways of performing a specific task, such as assigning grades to companies.

## Implementing the Strategy Pattern
To implement the strategy pattern, you need to:
* Define a strategy interface
* Implement concrete strategies that modify the company class and the code using it
* Select the strategy to use

## Prompt
```
Ok, so next let's explore the strategy pattern. What is it, how does it work, why would you use it, and demostrate and clearly explain the code for it.

Also, please give me some scenarios where additions to this code might be made easier with this pattern?
```

## Benefits of the Strategy Pattern
The strategy pattern provides a flexible way of switching strategies, making it easy to add new strategies or modify existing ones without affecting the rest of the code. This pattern can be useful for improving the quality of the code and building better software.
