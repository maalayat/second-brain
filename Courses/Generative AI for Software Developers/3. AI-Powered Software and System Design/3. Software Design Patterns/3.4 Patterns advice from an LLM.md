## Introduction
The video discusses the use of the singleton design pattern in managing data access within a mobile application, highlighting the learning process involved in discovering design patterns.

## Leveraging LLMs
- **Introduction of Chatbots**: The video introduces the concept of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze code and suggest design patterns.
- **Example Application**: An example application simulating a financial services app is presented, which includes:
  - A database of time series data (stock prices)
  - Functionality for data access and statistical calculations

```
Buiding a finacial services app

You are an expert Python developer who builds readable code. Together we will work on an application that has a database to store information, code to retrieve data from the database, and analytics that will run on the retrieve data.

First, let's create the database, which has a table for companies. The table will have three columns, the first is an id, the second the ticker for the company, the third is the name of the company. Create this, and synthesize data for 10 companies, adding that to the database.
```
## Code Creation and Exploration
- **Code Generation**: The author shares prompts used to create the application code, which includes:
  - Assigning roles and providing project context
  - Outlining the database schema
  - Generating synthetic stock price data
  - Calculating statistics (moving averages and Bollinger bands)

```
Now add another table called 'TimeSeries' that has four columns, an id for the row, the id for one of the companies, a value, and a date. Populate this with about 100 values per company, and have the dates be successive.
```

```
Now create code that when given a company ticker or an ID that it will extract the data for that company, and the time series data and load it into a company object. This object should have fields for high_bollinger which is the same data type as the time series, low_bollinger which is the same, moving_average which is the same, and a grade field which is a string.
```
## Interaction with LLM
- **Prompting the LLM**: The author suggests structuring prompts to ask the LLM for design pattern recommendations, specifically targeting software design patterns from the Gang of Four.
- **Suggested Patterns**: The LLM identifies four key design patterns to improve the code:
  1. **Singleton Pattern**: Recommended for database connections to optimize resource usage.
  2. **Factory Method Pattern**: Suggested for creating company objects.
  3. **Template Method Pattern**: For operations that follow a specific sequence.
  4. **Strategy Pattern**: For the grading algorithm based on price history.

```
You are an expert in software design patterns, particularly those from the Gang of Four, designed to make coding and maintenance more efficient. Please analyze the following code and suggest some changes that I could make based on good software engineering practice with these design patterns.
```
## Code Refactoring
- **Implementation of Patterns**: The LLM refactors the code to implement the suggested patterns, although the author notes that the initial prompt led to all changes being made at once.
- **Iterative Approach**: The author prefers to update the code pattern by pattern, allowing for better understanding and minimizing risks of errors.

```
Instead of making all the changes at once, please do them one at a time, going in order form Singleton to Factory to template Method to Strategy, and explain in detail why you made the changes and what impact they may have.
```
## Conclusion
The video concludes by encouraging viewers to explore the implementation of design patterns with the assistance of LLMs, starting with the singleton pattern for database connections in the next video.
