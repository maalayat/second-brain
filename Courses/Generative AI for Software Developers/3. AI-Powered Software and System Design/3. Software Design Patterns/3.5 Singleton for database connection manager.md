## Singleton Pattern Suggestion
### Importance of Singleton Pattern
- The LLM recommended implementing a **singleton pattern** for the database connection to ensure only one connection instance is used throughout the application.
- Benefits include:
  - Resource savings by limiting the number of connections.
  - Reduced attack surface for potential security threats.
  - Easier debugging due to a single point of connection.

### Implementation of Singleton Pattern

```
Enhance the following code to use the gang-of-four patterns. Strictly follow the common conventions for any patterns you choose.
```
- A new class, **DatabaseConnection**, was created to manage the SQLite database connection.
- A critical oversight was identified: the `get_connection` method was not defined as a static method, which could lead to confusion in the code.

## Identifying Issues
### Hallucination in Code
- The absence of a static method in the `get_connection` method could alter the API, leading to potential confusion when instantiating the singleton.
- Without the static method, developers might inadvertently create multiple instances, complicating the understanding of the code.

### Correcting the Code
- The correct implementation should ensure that the connection is intuitive and clearly indicates that only one connection exists.
- Using a static method simplifies the instantiation process, making it clearer that there is only one connection.

## Developer Expertise and LLM Limitations
- While LLMs can implement design patterns, they may not always adhere strictly to conventional practices.
- Developers must leverage their expertise to identify and correct any deviations in the generated code.

## Enhancing LLM Prompts
### Effective Prompting Strategies
- To improve the quality of code generated by the LLM, developers should:
  - Be specific in prompts, asking the LLM to strictly follow design pattern conventions.
  - Request the LLM to list conventions and explain how the generated code adheres to them.

Enance the following code to use the Singleton gang-of-four pattern. Strictly follow the common conventions for the pattern.

Start by explaining the conventions for the Singleton pattern and then describe how the code modifications you made strictly follow the conventions
