## Factory Pattern
- **Definition**: The factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass while allowing subclasses to specify the type of objects created.
- **Goal**: The main objective is to decouple the creation of objects from their usage, enhancing flexibility in object management.

## Implementation Details
- **Factory Class**: A factory class is created to manage the production of company objects, similar to a car factory producing different vehicle variations.
###  With context from a previous chat
```
Let's go back to the factory pattern, can you explain it in much more detail? It looks like this code may not benefit from it, but can you speculate about extensions to the code that might?
```

### New chat
```
Enhance the following code to use the Factory gang-of-four pattern. Strictly follow the common conventions for the pattern. Start by explaining the conventions for the Factory pattern and why it makes sense to use it here. Then describe how the code modifications you made strictly follow the conventions of the pattern

```

### Specific prompt 
```
Go back to the code that adds data to the database and synthesize some foreing companies(which will have a unique ID, but the ticker is always 'ZZZZ') and the data for them, both in the companies table and in the time series table.

Then fully explain the Factory pattern by having multiple companies types -- a Domestic Company that is denoted by its ticker, and a Foreign Company that is denoted by its ID.

Create code that shows how
