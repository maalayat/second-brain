## What are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They provide a standard way to structure and organize code for specific scenarios, enhancing code readability, reusability, and debugging.

## Benefits of Design Patterns
*   Enhance code readability and reusability
*   Help in debugging and preventing issues early in the design phase
*   Provide a standard terminology for developers to communicate ideas clearly and efficiently

## Challenges with Design Patterns
*   Can be difficult to understand and implement, especially for advanced patterns
*   Hard to determine whether a pattern is suitable for a specific use case without prior expertise

## How LLMs Can Help
*   Assist in understanding design patterns and their applications
*   Help assess whether a pattern is suitable for a specific use case
*   Aid in implementing design patterns in code

## The Gang of Four Design Patterns
*   Published in 1994 by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides
*   Categorized into three groups:
    *   **Creational patterns:** deal with object creation mechanisms
    *   **Structural patterns:** deal with the composition of classes or objects
    *   **Behavioral patterns:** characterize the ways in which classes or objects interact and distribute responsibility
