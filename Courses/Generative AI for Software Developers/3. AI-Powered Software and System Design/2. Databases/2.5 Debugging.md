## Introduction
This module has guided you through the development of a substantial code base, including table design, CRUD functionality, and query optimization. As you progress, encountering errors is inevitable, and knowing how to handle and debug them is crucial.

## Handling Database Connection Errors
```
How do I handle database connection errors in SQLAlchemy?
```
- **Common Issues**: One frequent error is the inability to connect to the database.
- **Solution**: Use a try-catch clause to manage connection errors in SQLAlchemy. Attempt to connect using `engine.connect`, and catch any operational errors to print the error message.

## Managing CRUD Operation Errors
```
How do I handle duplicate entry errors in SQLAlchemy?
```
- **Edge Cases**: As you expand your database functionality, you may face errors like inserting duplicate entries into tables with unique constraints.
- **Error Handling**: Utilize the `IntegrityError` type in SQLAlchemy to manage these errors. For instance, if a duplicate user is added, the error is caught and handled appropriately.

## Debugging with Logging
```
How do I enable SQL query logging in SQLAlchemy?
```
- **Importance of Logging**: Logging is a powerful debugging tool for SQL queries.
- **Implementation**: Enable SQL query logging with a simple prompt to the LLM. Initially, logs can be printed to the console, but you can modify the code to save logs to a file for production use.

## Transaction Errors
```
How do I handle transaction errores in SQLAlchemy?
```
- **Complex Updates**: Transaction errors can occur during complex database updates, potentially leaving the database in an inconsistent state.
- **Mitigation**: Implement a rollback mechanism in case of exceptions during transactions to maintain database integrity.

## Understanding Execution Plans
```
How do I use the EXPLAIN feature in SQLAlchemy to debug queries?
```
- **Execution Plans**: Understanding how queries execute is vital for optimizing performance, especially for complex queries.
- **Using EXPLAIN**: In SQLAlchemy, you can use the `EXPLAIN` functionality to analyze query execution. Query the LLM for guidance on how to implement this and interpret the output.
```
An EXPLAIN query gave me this output -- can you please tell me what it means?

## Conclusion
This module has equipped you with strategies to debug database errors effectively using an LLM. You are now prepared for the final exercise, which will further enhance your skills before moving on to the next module focused on software design patterns.
