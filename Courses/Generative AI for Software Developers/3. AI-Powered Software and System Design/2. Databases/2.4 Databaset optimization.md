## Introduction
Optimizing database structure and queries is essential for performance improvement. Collaborating with a Language Model (LLM) can enhance your understanding and provide inspiration for best practices.

## Initial Steps
- **High-Level Prompts**: Start with general questions to the LLM
```
What are some best practices to improve the performance of this database?
```
- **Detailed Responses**: The LLM can provide comprehensive answers, including specific areas to focus on, like indexing.

## Indexing
```
What are the best practices for indexing in a SQL database?
```
- **Importance of Indexing**: Smart indexing can significantly enhance data retrieval speed.
- **Best Practices for Indexing**:
  - Choose columns for indexing based on their use in WHERE or JOIN operations.
  - Avoid indexing large, complex data types (e.g., GUIDs).
- **Caution**: Use indexing judiciously; excessive indexing can lead to performance issues.

## Caching
```
How can I implement basic query caching in SQLAlchemy
```
- **Query Caching**: Reduces database load by storing results of expensive queries.
- **Implementation**: Use libraries like `dogpile.cache` for caching in SQLAlchemy.
- **Functionality**: Cache results for faster retrieval without altering the original function.

## Schema Design Considerations
```
What are the best practices for choosing data types in a SQL database?
```
- **Data Types**: Choose appropriate data types for columns to optimize performance.
- **Best Practices**: Use text for strings and limit length when possible.
- **LLM Assistance**: Prompt the LLM for best practices in data type selection to ensure adherence to optimization strategies.

## Conclusion
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and update your database design and queries based on best practices.
- **Next Steps**: Prepare for debugging processes in databases, leading to further exercises in optimization.
