## Introduction
In this module, you have been working with a Large Language Model (LLM) as a pair programmer to create a simple SQLite database for an e-commerce site using SQLAlchemy. You should now have a functioning database with CRUD operations for four tables: users, products, orders, and order items.

## Querying the Database
The next crucial step is learning how to query the database you have built. If you are already familiar with SQLAlchemy, this may be straightforward. However, if this is your first experience, the LLM can assist you in crafting queries.

### Simple Query Example
To illustrate how to use the LLM, start with a basic query. For instance, you can ask the model to write a SQLAlchemy query to find all orders placed by a specific user. When doing this in a new chat window, provide context by sharing your existing code, including the schema and CRUD operations, to help the model generate a more accurate query.
```
Write a SQLAlchemy query to find all orders placed by a specific user in the e-commerce database.

```

### Complex Query Example
The LLM is particularly useful for more complex queries. For example, if you want to find the total quantity of each product sold, you can prompt the LLM with a request to write a SQLAlchemy query for this purpose. The model will understand the database structure and generate a query that aggregates data from the Order_items table.
```
Write a SQLAlchemy query to find the total quantity of each product sold in this database
```

#### Key Features of the LLM
- **Understanding Database Structure**: The LLM can identify which tables to work with and how to group data without needing explicit instructions.
- **Aggregation Functions**: It utilizes SQL functions, such as `func.sum`, to perform calculations and summarize data effectively.

## Conclusion
The LLM can significantly enhance your ability to write and optimize database queries. In the next video, you will explore further how the LLM can assist in optimizing your database and the queries you create.
