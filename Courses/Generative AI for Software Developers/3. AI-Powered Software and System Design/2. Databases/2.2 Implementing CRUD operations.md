## Introduction
In this segment, the focus is on using a Large Language Model (LLM) to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in an e-commerce database. CRUD represents the four fundamental operations that can be performed on a database.

## Prerequisites
- **Database Setup**: Users should have a pre-existing database to follow along effectively. If not, they are advised to pause the video and create one.

```
What are the things to consider when you implement the create operation for a database?

## Create Operation
- **Definition**: The create operation involves adding new records to the database.
- **Considerations**: Important aspects to consider include data validation, security protocols against SQL injection, error handling, transaction management, and audit logging.
- **LLM Assistance**: The LLM can help generate functions for adding new users. For example, using SQLAlchemy APIs to create a function that inserts a new user into the database.

```
How can I create a function to add a new user to the users table of this database?
```
## Read Operation
- **Definition**: The read operation retrieves data from the database.
- **Implementation**: Users can prompt the LLM to create a function that queries the database for existing users. The output should confirm that the user was added correctly.

```
Generate code that implements a read function for this database.
It should return a list of all users currently in database
```
## Update Operation
- **Definition**: The update operation modifies existing records in the database.
- **Implementation**: Users can prompt the LLM to generate code for updating user information, such as an email address. The LLM understands the database structure and can provide relevant code.

```
Generate code that implements an update function for this database. I want to use it to update the email address of a user.
```

## Delete Operation
- **Definition**: The delete operation removes records from the database.
- **Implementation**: Users can ask the LLM to create a function that deletes a user based on their ID. The function should confirm the deletion by querying the database for remaining users.

```
Generate code that implement a delete function for this database. I want to use it to delete a user
```
## Security Considerations
- **Vulnerability Awareness**: There is a concern regarding SQL injection attacks, even when using APIs that abstract SQL commands.
- **LLM Guidance**: The LLM can provide insights on securing the code. It suggested using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) features to mitigate risks by storing data in classes.

```
I am using this code in a SQL database. Is there a chance that it's vulnerable to SQL injection attack as SQLAlchemy appears to use SQL under-the-hood?
