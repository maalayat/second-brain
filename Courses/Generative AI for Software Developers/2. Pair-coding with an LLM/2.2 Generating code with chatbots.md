## Introduction
This lesson explores how to utilize the GPT-4o model via the ChatGPT interface to enhance coding efficiency and automate development tasks.
## 
Writing Basic Functions
- **Python Example**: The lesson begins with a prompt to create a simple Python function that adds two numbers. The model successfully generates a function named `add_to_numbers` and provides an example of its usage.
- **JavaScript and C# Examples**: Similar prompts are used for JavaScript and C#, demonstrating the model's ability to adapt to different programming languages while maintaining clarity and correctness in syntax.

## Importance of Domain Knowledge
- The author emphasizes that while LLMs can generate code, developers' domain knowledge of programming languages, APIs, and business problems remains crucial for effective prompting and coding.

## Refining Prompts for Better Output
- **Specificity in Prompts**: The lesson highlights the importance of detailed prompts. For instance, asking for a Python function using NumPy leads to the inclusion of necessary imports and library functions.
- **Interactive Coding**: The model can be prompted interactively to improve code. An example is provided where a basic JavaScript function to check for prime numbers is enhanced with error handling through follow-up prompts.
```
Write a Javascript function to check if a number is prime
```

```
Update the function to include error handling for non-integer and non-positive inputs
```

## Handling Vague Prompts
- The lesson illustrates that vague prompts can yield ambiguous results. A prompt like "make a function" leads to a request for clarification, underscoring the need for specificity.

## Building a Web API
- A detailed prompt is given to create a Flask web API endpoint, resulting in a complete implementation that includes error handling and meets the specified requirements.
```
Can you help me create a simple Flask application in Python that includes one API endpoint? This endpoint should handle GET requests at the URL /multiply, which accepts two query parameters a and b and returns the multiplication of these two parameters as a JSON response. Make sure to include error handling if the parameters are not provided or if they are not convertible to integers
```

## Debugging with LLMs
- The model can assist in debugging by identifying errors in provided code. An example demonstrates how the model spots a potential divide-by-zero error and suggests improvements.
```
Help me find errors in this code:

def calculate_average(numbers):
  total_sum = sum(numbers)
  count = len(numbers)
  average = total_sum / count
  return average
```

## Practical Exercise
- The lesson concludes with a practical exercise, encouraging users to prompt ChatGPT to write a function that calculates the area of a circle. The author notes that general knowledge, such as the formula for the area, **is already embedded in the model's training data**.
```
Please write a Python function named calculate_area that takes an argument radius.

The function should calculate the area of a circle given the radius.
Ensure that the function handles non-numeric inputs by raising a ValueError with the message 'Input must be a numeric value'.

Include comments in the code explaining each step.
```

## Conclusion
- The key takeaway is that better prompts lead to better code. Users are encouraged to refine their prompts to include necessary details, such as error handling, to achieve optimal results from the model.
